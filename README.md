# Design Systems Workshop

A mock Twitter page implemented without, partially with, and then with a design system.

## Setup

Install npm dependencies, then start the local dev server:

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access a URL like `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
Visit `http://localhost:5173/native/0-start` to view the page.

## Workshop

We'll be walking through three steps in the workshop:

1. [Tokens](./docs/1-tokens)
2. [Components](./docs/2-components)
3. [Documentation](./docs/3-documentation)

> Inline documentation contains solutions to step exercises in `<details>` tags.
> I recommend viewing the docs files on GitHub so you can try to come to the solutions on your own. 🧠

### Takeaways

This workshop will teach you:

- Atomic Design and its three most common uses: tokens, atoms, and molecules 🎨
- How to break down a design into its atomic tokens, atoms, and molecules 🛠
- Strategies for incrementally implementing a design system in-place 🚀
- A plethora of VS Code shortcuts 🧑‍💻
